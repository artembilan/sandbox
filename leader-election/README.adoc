== Leader Election with Zookeeper

This sample demonstrate a distributed leader election and role control via Zookeeper.

A `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` in the application context is marked as not started from the beginning and supplied with a `myRole` role.
This role is used as a leadership election key in the `LeaderInitiatorFactoryBean` for Zookeeper server.

An embedded `TestingServer` from Curator Framework is started in a JUnit test class.
The unit test method starts two application context and verifies the `applicationEvents.txt` file content.
When both application context are active, we see events only from one of them since exactly this one is a leader.
When we stop the first application, the second takes a leadership, starts its endpoint and emits events for its environment.
So, in the end we start seeing those events in the end of `applicationEvents.txt` file.
